# Research - {{title}}

## Status

{{status}} - searched or measured {{date}}.

Research is evidence, not a decision: it records what exists, how good it is,
and how confident the finding is. The decision that follows belongs in an
[RFC](../rfcs/) and, once made, an [ADR](../adrs/).

## Question

{{question}}

State it precisely enough that a source either answers it or does not. "What
should we use for X" is not answerable; "which X can run inside a
wasm32-freestanding guest with no libc" is. For a measurement, say which
default or choice the numbers will settle.

## TL;DR

Three to six bullets, each one a finding with a link. Everything below is the
evidence for these lines.

- **Finding.** What it means for us - `high` / `medium` / `low` confidence - [source](https://example.invalid)

## Scope and method

- **Searched:** the queries and sources actually used (web, GitHub, code search,
  discussion archives, papers, the local tree).
- **Not searched:** what was skipped and why, so the next reader knows where the
  gaps are.
- **Freshness:** the date of the sweep, and the newest source found. Anything
  that ages fast (release cadence, pricing, hosted APIs) should say so.

For a measurement (a benchmark or experiment), the reproducibility contract
lives in the two sections below instead: a number is evidence only if a
stranger can re-run it.

## Harness

For measurement notes: the reproducible setup - machine and OS, toolchain
version, the exact commands that produced the numbers, the workload, and any
conditions that could affect them (load, filesystem, mounts). State enough
that the run can be repeated verbatim.

## Results

For measurement notes: the raw numbers with the environment and the date
they were taken, before analysis. Keep the implications out of this section;
they belong in the TL;DR and the analysis.

## Analysis

For measurement notes: what the numbers imply for the default or choice
they were taken to settle - the trade-off in the units that matter (per-op
cost against the expected rate), and the conclusion. State the limits
(hardware, load, filesystem) that bound it.

## Options found

One subsection per candidate. Include what it is before whether it is good.

### <Option> - <one line>

- **What it is:**
- **Maturity:** stars, last release, commit cadence, maintainer count, licence,
  known production users. Give the numbers and the date they were read.
- **Fit:** against the constraints in the question - language and toolchain,
  dependency budget, sandbox and network policy, platform support.
- **Pros:**
- **Cons:**
- **Unknowns:** what could not be established from the sources at hand.
- **Evidence:** links, each with what it actually shows.

## Out-of-the-box options

The candidates that a plain search does not return. Check each one explicitly
and say why it does or does not work, rather than dropping the heading:

- **Already in the tree:** an existing dependency, tool, or module that covers
  this if used differently.
- **Standard library / OS primitive:** the boring answer that needs no
  dependency at all.
- **Do nothing:** keep the workaround, and what that costs over time.
- **Adjacent domain:** how a neighbouring field solves the same shape of
  problem.
- **Buy, host, or delegate:** an external service or an existing binary called
  out to instead of code written here.

## Comparison

| Option | Maturity | Licence | Fit | Main risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

## Evidence log

Every claim above traces to a row here. Keep the rejected leads: knowing a
promising-looking option was checked and failed is worth as much as the winner.

| Claim | Source | Read on | Confidence |

|  |  |  |  |

## Open questions

What is still unresolved, and the specific search, benchmark, or spike that
would settle it.

## What would change the answer

The conditions under which this research goes stale - a release, a licence
change, a deprecation, a change in our own constraints.

## Appendix

Optional: raw sweep output, long quotes, benchmark numbers, and the queries in
full so the sweep can be repeated.
